Instructions

In this lab, you will take the template you made in class for a mad lib-styled story and create an interactive program for it!
Steps

    First, identify the different blanks in the story template you have. For each blank, declare a variable that will be able to store the user's response in an appropriate data type and with a variable name that describes what it is. For example, if a blank is for a whole number, you may choose to declare the following variable: int wholeNumber;
    After you have declared all your variables, create a series of prompts asking the user to enter their responses. Each prompt should ask the user for the appropriate information (with a cout statement) and then gather the user's response (with a cin statement saving the input into the corresponding variable you created in the previous step).
    Now the final step will be to display the "mad lib" story, but instead of blanks, you will place the user's input to make a funny, unique story.

Hint: remember that when you are using cout to display both literal text and variables, that you need to separate each part with the output operator <<. For example, if you have a variable called wholeNumber you could use this:

cout << "About " << wholeNumber << " days ago...";

Submitting

Press the Run button to make sure your code compiles. Fix any compilation errors you get. If it runs, try acting as the user in the Console and make sure the input and output works as you expect (and fix the code when necessary to improve it).

Once you are satisfied that your program works, press Submit.
